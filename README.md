softlayer-go [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/maximilien/softlayer-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/maximilien/softlayer-go#)
============

An *incomplete* SoftLayer (SL) client API written in Go language

**NOTE**: this client is created to support the (bosh-softlayer-cpi)[https://github.com/maximilien/bosh-softlayer-cpi] project and only implements the portion of the SL APIs needed to complete the implementation of the BOSH CPI.

**WARNING**: I make no promise nor guarantee that this SL client will be supported nor completed.
